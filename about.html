                <p>
                    <br>
                    My name is Ian McDonald and I am a 19 year old developer from Canada, I am currently enrolled at <a href="https://www.georgebrown.ca/" target="_blank">George Brown College.</a>
                    I am currently working on my <a href="https://www.georgebrown.ca/programs/computer-programming-and-analysis-program-t177" target="_blank">Computer Programming & Analysis</a> diploma.
                    I have developed a passion for programming ever since enrolling in college, and have activly been taking courses within and outside of school to advance my skills.
                    As of <date>April 25th, 2023</date>, I have completed my first year of College, with all passing grades.<br>

                    <br>
                    My passion in life is to live it to it's fullest potential and enjoy every day as if it were my last.
                    I have many hobbies that fuel my passions day to day, such as skateboarding, fashion, music and coding.
                    I have been skateboarding since 2018 and have been progressing my tricks when the Canadian weather allows.
                    As for coding, this was a hobby I initally took up during the beginning of the pandemic, and have been coding daily to improve my skills and overall knowledge.
                    I remeber the first thing i ever made was a selenium script in python that would simply just open the <a href="https://us.supreme.com/" target="_blank">Supreme</a> website and I was instantly hooked.
                    I would greatly state my appreciation and interest in coding as a whole due to bots such as CyberAIO, Balko, PD, MEKPreme and many more.
                    These applications where the reason I started coding in the first place.<br>
